## How to effectively shape the @OneToMany Associations

consider two entities Author and Book involved in a bidirectional lazy @OneToMany association

![image](images/imgone.png)

So the Author table has @OneToMany relationship with the book table. An author row can be referenced by multiple book rows.

The author_id column maps this relationship via foreign key that refrences the primary key of the author table.

A book column cannot exist without an author therefore the author is the parentoside (@OneToMany) while the book is the

child side (@ManyToOne)

The @ManyToOne association is responsible for synchronizing the foreign key column with the peristence context (the first level cache)

Rule of thumb

Always use bidirenctional @OneToMany associations instead of unidirectional ones due to performance constraints as explained in the section below

### Best way to code a bidirectional @OneToMany association

1. Always cascade from parent side to child side

   Cascading from child side to parent-side is a code smell and a bad practice and it is a clear signal that its time to review your domain model

   Think of how illogical it is for a child to cascade the creation of a parent

   in this case we cascade from Authors side to the Book side so we add the cascade type in the Author entity

   `@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.All)`

   Never use CascadeType.* on @ManyToOne since entity state transtions should be propagated from parent-side entities to child-side entities
2. Don't forget to set mappedby on the parent side

   The mappedBy attribute characterizes a bidirectional association and must be set on the parent side

   in other words for a bidirectional @OneToMany association, set mappedBy to @OneToMany on the parent side and add @ManyToOne on the child-side

   refrenced by mappedBy

   Via mappedBy, the bidirectional @OneToMany association signals that it mirrors the @ManyToOne child-side mapping

   in this case we add

   `@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy = "author")`
3. set orphanRemoval on the parent side

   Setting orphanRemoval on the parent-side gurantees the removal of children without refrences.

   Example

   `@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy = "author", orphanRemoval = true)`
4. Keep both sides of the Association in sync

   You can easily keep the both sides of the association in sync via helper methods added on the parent side

   commonly the addChild(), removeChild() and removeChildren()

   if you do not strive to keep both sides of the assocation in sync, the entity state transtions may lead to unexpected behaviours

   in this case we add the following helpers

   ```
   public void addBook(Book book) {
   this.books.add(book);
   book.setAuthor(this);
   }

   public void removeBook(Book book) {
   book.setAuthor(null);
   this.books.remove(book);
   }

   public void removeBooks() {
   Iteratorbook iterator = this.books.iterator();
   while (iterator.hasNext()) {
   Book book = iterator.next();
   book.setAuthor(null);
   iterator.remove();
   }
   }
   ```
5. overide equals() and hashCode()

   By properly overiding equals() and hashcode() methods the application obtains the same results across all entity state trasitions

   for @OneToMany associations these methods should be overriden on the child side

   incase we use the auto-generated database identifier to overide these two methods.

   The most important aspect to keep in mind is that, for autogenerated database identifiers, the equals() method should perform a null

   check on the identifier before performing an equality check and the hashCode() method should return a constant value

   Since the Book entity is on the child side we highlight these two aspects as follows

   ```
   @Override
   public boolean equals(Object obj) {
   ...
   return id != null && id.equals(((Book) obj).id);
   }
   @Override
   public int hashCode() {
   return 2021;
   }
   ```
6. Use lazy fetching on both sides of the association

   by default fetching a parent will not fetch children entities

   This means @OneToMany is lazy

   On the other hand, feching a child entity will eagerly fetch its parent by default

   Its adisable to exlicitly set @ManyToOne to lazy and rey on eager fetching only on query basis

   in this case we Book entity explicitly maps @ManyToOne as lazy

   @ManyToOne(fetch =  FetchType.LAZY)
7. Pay attention to how toString() is overridden

   if toString() is to be overriden, then be sure to involve the basic attributes fetched when the entity is loaded from the database

   involving lazy attributes or associations will trigger separate SQL statements that fetch the corresponsidng data and throw LazyInitalizationException.

   example when we implement the toString() method for Author entity then we dont mention the books collection, we mention only the basic attributes

   (id, name, age and genre)

   ```
   @Override
   public String toString() {
   return "Author{" + "id=" + id + ", name=" + name 
   + ", genre=" + genre + ", age=" + age + '}';
   }
   ```
8. Use @JoinColumn to specify the Join Column Name

   The join column defined by the owner entity (Book) stores the ID value and has a foreign key to the Author entity

   its adivisable to specify the desired name for this column

   This way you avoid potential confusions/msiatkes when reffering to it (e.g in native queries)

   In this case we add @JoinColumn to the book entity as follows

   `@JoinColumn(name = "author_id)`

pay attention to remove entities operations especially child entities operations

While CascadeType.Remove and orphanRemoval=true will do their jobs but they may produce too may SQL statements

Relying on bulk operations is the best way to delete any significant amount of entities

## Why should you avoid the unidirectional @OneToMany Association

Consider the Author and Book entities are involved in a bidirectional lazy @OneToMany association

Trying to insert a child entity, a book will result in one SQL INSERT statement trggered aganist the book table

Trying to delete will result in one SQL delete statement trggered aganist the book table

Now lets assume that the same Author and Book entities are involved in a unidirectional @OneToMany association

```
@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
private Listbook books = new ArrayList<>();
```

The missing @ManyToOne association leads to separate junction table(author_books) meant to manage the parent-child association

example

![image.png](assets/imagetwo.png)

The junction table holds two foreign keys, so indexing consumes more memmory than in the case of bidirectional relationship @OneToMany

Moreover having three tables affects the query operations as well

Reading the data may require three joins instead of two as in the case of bidirectional @ManyToOne association

lets see how INSERT AND DELETE act in unidirectional relationship

### Regular Unidirectional @OneToMany

checking how the INSERT and

#### Persisting Author and their books

The service method for persisting an author and the associated books is as follows

```
@Transactional
public void insertAuthorWithBooks() {
Author jn = new Author();
jn.setName("Joana Nimar");
jn.setAge(34);
jn.setGenre("History");
Book jn01 = new Book();
jn01.setIsbn("001-JN");
jn01.setTitle("A History of Ancient Prague");
Book jn02 = new Book();
jn02.setIsbn("002-JN");
jn02.setTitle("A People's History");
Book jn03 = new Book();
jn03.setIsbn("003-JN");
jn03.setTitle("World History");
jn.addBook(jn01);
jn.addBook(jn02);
jn.addBook(jn03);
authorRepository.save(jn);
}
```

inspecting the generated SQL statements reveals that in comparison to the bidirectional @OneToMany association there are 3 additional insert statementsin the junction table (for n books there are n additiinal inserts)

```
INSERT INTO author (age, genre, name)
VALUES (?, ?, ?)
Binding:[34, History, Joana Nimar]
INSERT INTO book (isbn, title)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[001-JN, A History of Ancient Prague]
INSERT INTO book (isbn, title)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[002-JN, A People's History]
INSERT INTO book (isbn, title)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[003-JN, World History]
```

-- additional inserts that are not needed for bidirectional @OneToMany

```
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[1, 1]
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[1, 2]
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[1, 3]
```

so in this context the unidirectional @OneToMany association is less efficient than bidirectional @OneToMany association

#### Persisting a new book of an existing author

Since Joana Nimar has just published a new book, we have to add it to the book table. This time, the service-method looks as follows:

@Transactional
public void insertNewBook() {
Author author = authorRepository.fetchByName("Joana Nimar");
Book book = new Book();
book.setIsbn("004-JN");
book.setTitle("History Details");
author.addBook(book); // use addBook() helper
authorRepository.save(author);
}

Calling this method and focusing on SQL INSERT statements results in the following output:

```
INSERT INTO book (isbn, title)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[004-JN, History Details]
-- the following DML statements don't appear in bidirectional @OneToMany
DELETE FROM author_books
WHERE author_id = ?
Binding:[1]
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[1, 1]
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[1, 2]
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?)Binding:[1, 3]
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[1, 4]
```

So, in order to insert a new book, the JPA persistence provider (Hibernate) deletes all the associated books from the junction table and it adds the new book in-memmory and persists again

This is far from being efficient and potential performance penalty is quite obvius

#### Deleting the last book

Deleting the last book involves fetching the associated List of an author and deleting the last book from this list, as follows:

```
@Transactional
public void deleteLastBook() {
Author author = authorRepository.fetchByName("Joana Nimar");
Listbook books = author.getBooks();
// use removeBook() helper
author.removeBook(books.get(books.size() - 1));
}
```

Calling deleteLastBook() reveals the following relevant SQL statements:

```
DELETE FROM author_books
WHERE author_id = ?
Binding:[1]
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[1, 1]
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[1, 2]
```

-- for bidirectional @OneToMany this is the only needed DML

```
DELETE FROM book
WHERE id = ?
Binding:[3]
```

So, in order to delete the last book, the JPA persistence provider (Hibernate) deletes all associated books from the junction table, removes in-memory the last book, and persists the remaining books back again.

So, in comparison to the bidirectional @OneToMany association, there are several additional DML statements representing a performance penalty.

The more associated books there are, the larger the performance penalty.

#### Deleting the first book

Deleting the first book involves fetching the associated List of an author and deleting the first book from this list, as follows:

```
@Transactional
public void deleteFirstBook() {
Author author = authorRepository.fetchByName("Joana Nimar");
Listbook books = author.getBooks();
author.removeBook(books.get(0));
}
```

Calling deleteFirstBook() reveals the following relevant SQL statements:

```
DELETE FROM author_books
WHERE author_id = ?
Binding:[1]
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[1, 2]
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[1, 3]
```

-- for bidirectional @OneToMany this is the only needed DML

```
DELETE FROM book
WHERE id = ?
Binding:[1]
```

So, deleting the first book acts exactly as deleting the last book.

Besides the performance penalties caused by the dynamic number of additional SQL statements, we also face the performance penalties caused by the deletion and reinsertion of the index entries associated with the foreign key column of the junction table (most databases use indexes for foreign key columns).

When the database deletes all the table rows associated with the parent entity from the junction table, it also deletes the corresponding index entries. When the database inserts back in the junction table, it inserts the index entries as well.

### Using @OrderColumn

By adding the @OrderColumn annotation, the unidirectional @OneToMany association becomes ordered. In other words, @OrderColumn instructs Hibernate to materialize the element index (index of every collection element) into a separate database column of the junction table so that the collection is sorted using an ORDER BY clause. In this case, the index of every collection element is going to be stored in the books\_order column of the junction table.

#### Persist the Author and Books

Persisting the author and the associated books from the snapshot via the insertAuthorWithBooks() service-method triggers the following relevant SQL statements:

```
INSERT INTO author (age, genre, name)
VALUES (?, ?, ?)
Binding:[34, History, Joana Nimar]
INSERT INTO book (isbn, title)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[001-JN, A History of Ancient Prague]
INSERT INTO book (isbn, title)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[002-JN, A People's History]
INSERT INTO book (isbn, title)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[003-JN, World History]
```

-- additional inserts not needed for bidirectional @OneToMany

```
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_order, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?, ?)
Binding:[1, 0, 1]
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_order, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?, ?)
Binding:[1, 1, 2]
INSERT INTO author
_books (author_id, books_order, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?, ?)
Binding:[1, 2, 3]
```

Looks like @OrderColumn doesn’t bring any benefit. The three additional INSERT statements are still triggered.

#### Persist a New Book of an Existing Author

Persisting a new book via the insertNewBook() service-method triggers the following relevant SQL statements:

```
INSERT INTO book (isbn, title)
VALUES (?, ?)
Binding:[004-JN, History Details]
-- this is not needed for bidirectional @OneToMany
INSERT INTO author_books (author_id, books_order, books_id)
VALUES (?, ?, ?)
Binding:[1, 3, 4]
```

There is good news and bad news!

The good news is that, this time, Hibernate doesn’t delete the associated books to add them back from memory.

The bad news is that, in comparison to bidirectional @OneToMany association, there is still an additional INSERT statement in the junction table. So, in this context, @OrderColumn brought some benefit.

#### Delete the Last Book

Deleting the last book via deleteLastBook() triggers the following relevant SQL statements:

```
DELETE FROM author_books
WHERE author_id = ?
AND books_order = ?
Binding:[1, 2]
```

-- for bidirectional @OneToMany this is the only needed DML

```
DELETE FROM book
WHERE id = ?
Binding:[3]
```

Looks like @OrderColumn brought some benefit in the case of removing the last book. The JPA persistence provider (Hibernate) did not delete all the associated books to add the remaining back from memory.

But, in comparison to the bidirectional @OneToMany association, there is still an additional DELETE triggered against the junction table.

#### Delete the First Book

Deleting the first book via deleteFirstBook() triggers the following relevant SQL statements:

```
DELETE FROM author_books
WHERE author_id = ?
AND books_order = ?
Binding:[1, 2]
UPDATE author_books
SET books_id = ?
WHERE author_id = ?
AND books_order = ?
Binding:[3, 1, 1]
UPDATE author_books
SET books_id = ?
WHERE author_id = ?
AND books_order = ?
Binding:[2, 1, 0]
```

-- for bidirectional @OneToMany this is the only needed DML

```
DELETE FROM book
WHERE id = ?
Binding:[1]
```

The more you move away from the end of the collection, the smaller the benefit of using @OrderColumn. Deleting the first book results in a DELETE from the junction table followed by a bunch of UPDATE statements meant to preserve the in-memory order of the collection in the database. Again, this is not efficient.

Adding @OrderColumn can bring some benefits for removal operations. Nevertheless, the closer an element to be removed is to the head of the fetched list, the more UPDATE statements are needed.

This causes performance penalties. Even in the best-case scenario (removing an element from the tail of the collection), this approach is not better than bidirectional @OneToMany association.
